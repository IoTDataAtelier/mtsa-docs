## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Contribute

This is a living document, and contributions from everyone are essential.

> [!WARNING]
> **THE GOLDEN RULE:** Whenever a feature is added, changed, or removed in the `main` branch of the [main MTSA repository](https://github.com/IoTDataAtelier/mtsa), this documentation **MUST** be updated to reflect that change. Keeping the docs in sync is critical.

1.  **Create a New Branch**
  Always start from an up-to-date `main` branch.
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
  > **Note:** Follow GitFlow best practices when naming branches and writing commit messages.

2.  **Add or Edit Content**
  All documentation content is written in Markdown (`.md`) files located in the `src/content/docs/` directory.

3.  **Commit and Push Your Changes**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "docs: Add documentation for feature X"
  git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

4.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
  On GitHub, open a Pull Request from your branch to `main` so other team members can review your changes.
