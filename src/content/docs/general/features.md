- **Unified Framework:** MTSA provides a modular and extensible structure for developing and testing anomaly detection models on multiple time series.
- **State-of-the-Art Implementations:** The framework includes implementations of three state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches: Hitachi, RANSynCoders, and GANF.
- **Enhanced Pipelines:** RANSynCoders and GANF pipelines have been enhanced with feature extraction based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), improving their performance on acoustic data.
- **Comparative Analysis:** MTSA enables easy comparison of different approaches, with a focus on acoustic data from industrial machinery.
