MTSA is a unified framework for anomaly detection in multiple time series, designed to 
facilitate the replication and development of state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches. 
The framework is particularly focused on handling acoustic data from industrial machinery, 
such as valves, pumps, fans, and slide rails.
